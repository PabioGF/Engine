# **Aditional elements**
For the UI configurations, I added one for scaling the model.

Apart from zooming with the mouse wheel, you can also scale with Alt + Right click.

You can also pan by maintaining the left click held down.

# **Comments**
All the model and program generation is done from ModuleRenderExercise.

For the logs in the console, I added a vector that stores the log to use it in the ModuleEditor, so every LOG that is called is output in the console.

There is a memory leak from LoadASCIIFromFile() function that I didn't know how to solve.
